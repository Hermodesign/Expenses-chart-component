## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I solidified my knowledge of positioning elements and learned how to use the FrontendMentor website, which will be very useful for future projects.

### Continued development

I would like to further my knowledge on other types of CSS positioning, animation techniques, and using SASS. Additionally, I want to expand my knowledge by using JavaScript in more depth, as well as React.
